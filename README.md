### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP
- I want to have the ability to have users add thier data to a database if they have a house to sell.
- I want to keep a list of potential buyers if my pot runith over.
- I want to list all my rentals with pictures.
- I want the ability to full crud all the above models to eliminate any database work needed directly.
- I want to add some formatting that shows this isn't straight out of the can django.

#### Future enhancements
- What i would like to add more data to display:
    - I want to add an API/Datascrape/with update functions to the MLS of the local realtor board.
    - I want to add an API/Datascrape/with update functions to the FSBO's around the area.
    - I want to add join both data models to give more information about the properites for sale, probably based on address.
    - I want to setup a few screens that show houses that have sold within the last 5-10years
